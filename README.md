This github repository contains the MATLAB and C++ source code 
used to generate results for the SIMAX publication, 
"A distributed and Incremental SVD Algorithm for Agglomerative Data Analysis on Large Networks"
[(doi entry)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/16M1058467).  This code provides no guarantees, and is 
supported only as time permits.  You can contact the author at ongbw[at]mtu[dot]edu.
